## I CHING RINGS

1) A loop (ring) of concatenated I Ching hexagrams passing through all 64 hexagrams without repetition.

2) A bit must always be the closest approximation to the reference hexagram, that is, the last 6-bits formed figure must be as similar as possible to the first 6-bits.

3) The method gives 64 results, 32 of which have inverted reciprocals within the family.

4) Each solution requires more or less iterations to solve.

(1) Many solutions can be found, yet to be categorized and counted. (2) Only one solution possible for each hexagram. (3) Optimally, the whole family is interpreted as reciprocals different from each other. (4) Initial algorithm needs at least 89 steps (unique case for "0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1" and "1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0"). Most are solved around 100~120 steps. Four reciprocal exceptions take 809, 1226801, 1180856 and 278483150 steps (the last being for "1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1" and "0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0").


*The first sequence, based on "0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0", and its reciprocal "1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1", coincides with A169671 "Lexicographically earliest de Bruijn sequence for n = 6 and k = 2".*
